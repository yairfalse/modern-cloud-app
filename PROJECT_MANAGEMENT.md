### Project Automation Rules

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Integration
- name: AI Issue Management
  triggers: [push, pull_request]
  actions:
    - Claude Code can analyze changes and create follow-up issues
    - Dagger agent performs security and performance analysis
    - Automated labeling and milestone assignment

- name: Smart Project Board
  triggers: [issue_update, pr_update]
  actions:
    - Auto-move issues between project columns
    - AI-powered progress tracking
    - Stakeholder notifications with AI insights
```

## ðŸ“Š Project Structure Benefits

### For Development Team
